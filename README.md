# TeamsDispatcher
TeamsDispatcher is a program that aims to distribute players fairly and randomly into a given number of teams.

## Explication
When you start the program, you have two input options available to you. <br>
The first one is the area where you fill in the names of all the participants. Each name must be separated by a semicolon ( ; ). <br>
The second is the area where you have to fill in how many teams you want the players to be divided into. <br>
<br>
Then you just have to press the button "Distribute the players". If the number you have entered cannot be distributed fairly, a final team will be created with the players that cannot be distributed fairly.

## Installation
On the right side of the GitHub directory, you will find a "Releases" category. By clicking on "TeamsDispatcher executable program", it will send you to the program installation page. You just have to click on "TeamsDispatcher.exe" and it's done !
